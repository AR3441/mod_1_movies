# mod_1_movies
This project was done by Menachi Korn and Atiar Rahman.
We first scraped data from Box Office Mojo to get the top grossing movies for every year from 1989 to 2019. Then two APIs were called to get rating, director and budget info among other information. This information was put into a Pandas Dataframe as well as a SQL database.
The data was then analyzed to first see if there is any correlation between critic ratings and movie world wide gross.
